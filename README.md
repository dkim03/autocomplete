# Description
This program takes an input prefix and outputs a list of most likely words given a .txt file of words and their corresponding weights. The program implements a balanced BST coupled with a map data structure to quickly retrieve data given a list containing thousands of words.

# Purpose
This project was created to practice the application of data structures to problems requiring efficient solutions.
